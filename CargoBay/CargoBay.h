/**
 `CargoBay` provides a convenient block-based API to StoreKit functionality, as well as advanced functionality like receipt and transaction verification and external product information querying.
 
 ## Product Information Lookup
 
 Localized product information can be queried from a set of known identifiers or fetched from an external webservice.

 ## Transaction & Receipt Verification
 
 Completed transactions contains a signed receipt that records all the critical information for the transaction. This can be easily posted to the App Store to verify that the receipt is valid and has not been tampered with. Transactions can also be validated to be unique, according to a local or remote database.

 ## Transaction Queue Observer Delegate Methods
 
 The `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` protocol declares methods that are implemented by `CargoBay`, acting as an observer of the `SKPaymentQueue` object. Observer delegate methods are provided as block callbacks for convenience.
